This project is a simple implementation of the classic "Snake Water Gun" game (similar to Rock Paper Scissors) in Python. The user plays against the computer, choosing between snake, water, or gun, and the winner is decided based on the game's rules.

## Features

- Command-line interface
- Randomized computer choices

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. Choose your move: snake, water, or gun.
3. The computer will make its move.
4. The winner is displayed after each round.

## About

This project was developed during my first-year summer break out of boredom. It was a fun way to practice Python basics and simple game logic.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script using Python 3:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

Enjoy playing!
